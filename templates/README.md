Notes on current atef checkouts

All checkouts have the verify before moving to next steps disabled
If you have a device that has more than 6 states please adjust the timeout and settle times for each step. You might either have to max out these time fields OR increase the motor velocities so that the motor makes it in time. 
If you have issues with the check value after the set value step please reach out to Robert or Christian
